Why c++ do not need any garbage collector?
Because Bjarne told, we can eliminate the use of garbage collection by not producing any garbage.
C++ does not create any garbage,its the developer who creates garbage.

Its the responsblity of developer to deallocate dynamically allocated memory.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class box{
public:
int x;

box()=default;
box(int a):x(a){}

box* add(box a,box b)
{
    box *c=new box();
    c->x=a.x + b.x;
    return c;
}

};
int main()
{
    box a1(10),a2(19);
    box *obj=new box();
    cout<<(obj->add(a1,a2))->x;
}

Here  developer forget to delete obj and it can lead to memory leak;

we can use this example to show why we need to specify default constructor, when we do not want to initialize object and we have parameterized constructor
